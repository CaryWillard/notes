# Service Level Indicators & Service Level Objectives

## SLIs

### User facing systems (frontend)

- Availability
    - Is the service up?
- Latency
    - How long does it take serve a request?
- Throughput
    - How many requests can we serve?

### Storage systems

- Availability
- Latency
- Durability

### Big data systems

- Throughput
- End-to-end latency

### All systems

- Correctness (usually not an infrastructure / SRE concern)
